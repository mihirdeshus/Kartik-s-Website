      NISHKAM KARMA 
    </div>
    <div id="essay2" class="content">
      <p>
        This topic is essentially inspired by the Bhagavad Gita and I got reintroduced to it during a recent lecture at university. The idea of Nishkam Karma—performing actions without expecting any rewards—has been a game-changer for me. It’s made me realize that the true key to happiness is letting go of expectations, both positive and negative.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you desire a specific outcome, you’re essentially trying to control life. You start chasing what you want instead of aligning with the bigger picture, the ultimate truth. And when reality doesn’t match up with those desires, that’s when life feels unfair, and frankly, sad. But how do you not desire something? We’re human, desiring is an irrational outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s hoping your crush says yes, cheering for your favorite F1 team to win (had to include that for the cool kids), or simply wishing to pass that one tough class, it’s natural to want results in our favor. But attaching your happiness to any outcome is the root of all unhappiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what’s the alternative? Mindfulness. The past often leaves us scarred, the future is a constant source of anxiety. What truly matters is observing, living, and getting the best out of the present; there is so much this world has to offer when living in the moment. When being dragged to a family gathering at your least favorite uncle’s house; instead of counting the minutes, talk to that cousin you barely know, listen to some nostalgic family stories, or just enjoy the food (especially if it's an Indian gathering). You are anyway going to stay there, rather get the best out of the time you stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's by practicing ‘detached attachment’. Where you give your 100%, but you don’t let the outcome define you. It’s this balance of being present without being possessive. M.S. Dhoni is called "Captain Cool" because he focuses on the process: preparing well, controlling what he can, and trusting that things will unfold as they’re meant to. He often says, “Control the controllables,” as when you stop obsessing over results, you free yourself from unnecessary pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nishkam Karma isn't about giving up on dreams or goals. It’s about shifting your perspective. It’s about understanding that while you have control over your actions, you have limited control over the outcomes.

     DO WE REALLY CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS?
    </div>
    <div id="essay3" class="content">
      <p>
        Have you ever tried to stop thinking about something? From a song stuck in your mind, to that one person you can't stop forgetting about, or an embarrassing moment from years ago suddenly popping up in the middle of work, we can never silence thoughts in our heads. But the question remains, how much can we control our thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        Philosophy 101 at uni gave me a pathway back to my shower thoughts I had as an 8 year old, all of these questions I had in mind that time can actually be answered by the depths of this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Descartes said “I think therefore I am”, which means that the act of thinking itself is the proof of existence, implies that we do have control over our thoughts. But if you look at the Eastern philosophies like Buddhism, they view thoughts like clouds passing in the sky, you don’t control them—you just notice them floating by. This sounds realistic since half the time we are not even sure where our thoughts come from. Around 95% of our brain activity happens unconsciously, explaining why the most random memories hit you in the shower. So, do we control thoughts… or just nudge them?
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve learned that fighting thoughts make them louder, accepting them–or even welcoming them–makes them quieter. We're not the dictators of our minds, but we're not completely powerless either. The brain is flexible–neuroplasticity is the term for it. You can't silence every thought, but you can choose which ones deserve your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        So no, I don’t think we completely control our thoughts. But that doesn’t mean we’re powerless. It’s more like we’re gardeners—not dictators. We don't have an absolute control over our thoughts. But we do have agency in how we respond to them, how we relate to them, and what we choose to cultivate in our minds over time.
