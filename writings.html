      LIFE'S ASYMMETRIC RETURNS
    </div>
    <div id="essay1" class="content">
      <p>
        Life has a way of surprising us with asymmetric returns—outcomes that far exceed the investment, effort, or attention we initially put into them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take failures. A failed exam? A broken relationship? Absolute gems of life. Failures are not setbacks but stepping stones, and it takes courage to embrace them as fuel for your next attempt. At first glance, these experiences might seem like setbacks or meaningless nuisances, but they leave marks that guide us, sometimes subtly, toward better decisions and new perspectives. The beauty of asymmetric returns is that they can emerge from the most unexpected places. Something as mundane as scrolling reels through Instagram or having silly, aimless conversations with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Steve Jobs dropped out of college. At the time, it might have seemed a rash thing to do. In his spare time, he chose to audit a calligraphy class out of pure curiosity. Years later, when designing the Macintosh, that class became the foundation for incorporating beautiful typography into Apple computers, revolutionizing user interface design. A seemingly big decision, born out of failure and uncertainty, ended up shaping the way we interact with technology today.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a personal note, my love for Economics and Finance? Sparked not by a textbook or a lecture but a baseball movie. That’s right—Moneyball. Who knew a film about statistics in sports could decide my career trajectory? Asymmetric returns show up not just in stock markets but also in Brad Pitt movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although asymmetric returns require an input—inaction anyways guarantees nothing, it's better to even put a small effort into anticipating unexpected gains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of asymmetric returns is a reminder that every experience—good, bad, or seemingly pointless—holds the potential for outsized impact, reminding us to embrace uncertainty and approach every experience with an open mind. So keep going, keep failing, and keep scrolling—because you never know when life’s going to pull a Steve Jobs on you and turn your “mistake” into the next big thing.

      NISHKAM KARMA - THE PHILOSOPHY OF DETACHED ACTION
    </div>
    <div id="essay2" class="content">
      <p>
        This topic is essentially inspired by the Bhagavad Gita and I got reintroduced to it during a recent lecture at university. The idea of Nishkam Karma—performing actions without expecting any rewards—has been a game-changer for me. It’s made me realize that the true key to happiness is letting go of expectations, both positive and negative.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you desire a specific outcome, you’re essentially trying to control life. You start chasing what you want instead of aligning with the bigger picture, the ultimate truth. And when reality doesn’t match up with those desires, that’s when life feels unfair, and frankly, sad. But how do you not desire something? We’re human, desiring is an irrational outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s hoping your crush says yes, cheering for your favorite F1 team to win (had to include that for the cool kids), or simply wishing to pass that one tough class, it’s natural to want results in our favor. But attaching your happiness to any outcome is the root of all unhappiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what’s the alternative? Mindfulness. The past often leaves us scarred, the future is a constant source of anxiety. What truly matters is observing, living, and getting the best out of the present; there is so much this world has to offer when living in the moment. When being dragged to a family gathering at your least favorite uncle’s house; instead of counting the minutes, talk to that cousin you barely know, listen to some nostalgic family stories, or just enjoy the food (especially if it's an Indian gathering). You are anyway going to stay there, rather get the best out of the time you stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's by practicing ‘detached attachment’. Where you give your 100%, but you don’t let the outcome define you. It’s this balance of being present without being possessive. M.S. Dhoni is called "Captain Cool" because he focuses on the process: preparing well, controlling what he can, and trusting that things will unfold as they’re meant to. He often says, “Control the controllables,” as when you stop obsessing over results, you free yourself from unnecessary pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nishkam Karma isn't about giving up on dreams or goals. It’s about shifting your perspective. It’s about understanding that while you have control over your actions, you have limited control over the outcomes.

      THE HIDDEN POWER OF YOUR FIRST PRINCIPLES
    </div>
    <div id="essay3" class="content">
      <p>
        In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, adhering to first principles—the fundamental truths that serve as the foundation for our beliefs and actions—has become important.
      </p>
      <p>
        First principles thinking is about breaking down complex problems into their simplest components. It’s not about overthinking—it’s about thinking right. When questioning the high costs associated with traditional rockets, Elon Musk identified that raw materials constituted only a fraction of the expenses. From this fundamental insight, SpaceX was born, and space exploration started sounding less like science fiction and more like a viable industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        When students may be buried in academic pressure, feeling overwhelmed. Instead of trying to memorize every single detail, you take a first-principles approach: Why am I studying? To understand the core concepts that will likely show up on the test. You strip it down to the basics, identify key topics, and focus your energy on mastering them. Suddenly, the workload feels manageable, and you’re actually learning instead of just cramming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strict adherence to first principles can lead to rigidity, but it is essential to recognize that these principles are not constraints but foundational guidelines. In workouts, pushups and pullups exemplify how basics provide a foundation; mastering them ensures flexibility and adaptability for more advanced routines. First principles ensure that decisions remain grounded in fundamental truths while accommodating necessary adjustments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sticking to first principles is about reclaiming the art of thoughtful decision-making. It’s not flashy, it’s not trendy, but it works. And in a world drowning in noise, isn’t that exactly what we need?

      SPORTS: LIFE BEYOND HEALTH
    </div>
    <div id="essay4" class="content">
      <p>
        Growing up, playing sports has taught me just as much as my academics- perhaps even more. Over time, I’ve realized that sports are not just about improving health or serving as mindless entertainment for those Sunday evenings. It is beyond what we can see, sports are the unsung professors of life, teaching you lessons that no classroom can match—discipline, decision-making, and a nuanced perspective on life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sports boost your analytical skills by forcing you to anticipate your opponent’s next move while optimizing your own—within mere seconds. Take squash, for instance. I’ve learned to analyze the ball’s trajectory, calculate the distance between it and me, and simultaneously gauge where my opponent is standing only so that I can hit the ball at the right place of the court so that they miss it. All this mental math happens faster than you can say "game point.". And this reflexive decision-making spills over into life, where you often need to think on your feet—like when you’re caught in traffic with two minutes to make it to an exam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Playing and watching sports has also taught me an invaluable life hack: you don’t have to be the best at everything, just better than most. Life is, after all, a game of averages. Why stress about acing every competition when you can focus on simply outdoing the person next to you? So now, whenever I encounter competition, I smile inwardly, reminding myself that my only goal is to edge ahead—not dominate. It’s efficient, it’s realistic, and it saves a ton of mental energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sports also give you an identity, a badge of honor you can proudly wear—because, "I’m good at sports" sounds much cooler than "I’m the kid who never misses a deadline." It becomes part of your story, something that makes you stand out. It shows the world you’ve been consistent at something (even if it’s just chasing a ball). People look at you and think, Wow, this person must be hardworking. Or at the very least, Well, they’re persistent enough to not quit after losing their first game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sports leave an indelible mark on your life by teaching you to navigate its unpredictable twists and turns. Life is full of peaks and valleys, wins and losses. At your highs, sports teach you to celebrate—but not too much; humility is key. At your lows, they remind you that it’s just a phase. Virat Kohli, who went two years without a century (an eternity for cricket fans). He detached, took a break, and focused on himself—only to come back and silence his critics with a glorious century. "When the fishermen can’t go to sea, they repair their nets." So when life doesn’t go your way—be it in business, relationships, or anything else—just focus on yourself. Eventually, the tide will turn, and you’ll find your rhythm again. And that is not something academics, but only sports can teach you.

      UNCHANGING TRUTH IN A CHANGING WORLD
    </div>
    <div id="essay5" class="content">
    <p>
      "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it" – Daniel Kahneman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life can surprise one sometimes. While big gestures or a well-laid plan will always be with us, our actual growth more often than not arises from the silent truths we pass along the way. Modesty, resiliency, sincerity—are, as truisms, not highly valued, for it is their simplicity that powers them as they help lead us subtly into becoming a better version of ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humility doesn't immediately evoke notions of something we should take on or embody, but humility isn't passive; it isn't something that says, "Give way and shrink." Humility does the opposite; it makes us bigger. It prods us to acknowledge when we don't know, to ask for help, and to learn from people around us. Some of the most transformative lessons in life are not because of what we achieved but because of those moments when we realize how much more there is yet to be learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authenticity is the bravery to live a life that feels like yours. In a world full of comparisons and curated social media personas, staying true to yourself is an act of rebellion. But it's also an act of growth. When you stop chasing what others expect and start aligning with what you value, you unlock a deeper sense of purpose—and purpose is the foundation for any meaningful progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timeless truths won't make your video go viral overnight or create overnight sensations. But quietly, like a seed growing roots before it grows into a tree, the impact compounds. They remind us that growth is not always dramatic or visible. Sometimes it's in the ordinary choices of responsibility, kindness, and persistence that we are most transformed. So, lean into them. Take hold of these truths not because they're profound but because they work. Growth doesn't have to look the way you think it should. But when you have time-tested truths guiding you, growth is always worthwhile.
